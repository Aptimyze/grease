GREASE Installation
*********************

Via PyPi: The Traditional Way
===================================

GREASE is built like any other traditional python software, as a package. This means many things but luckily for
the systems administrator it means we traverse the typical PyPi pipeline allowing for you to specify your version
and allow for updates to be pretty easy. Here is the installation steps:

#. Run `pip install tgt_grease`
#. Setup your configuration file

From Source on GitHub: Because you're cool like that
=========================================================

GREASE is developer friendly! We're always looking for new ways to bring joy to our guests as well as our developers. To
install GREASE via source follow these steps:

#. Download the repo either via Git or HTTP from GitHub
#. Enter the project folder you created
#. Run `python setup.py install`

   - **NOTE:** We recommend for all use cases to use a virtual environment

#. Setup your configuration file
